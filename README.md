Work plan:
- [ ] Add and connect all components in EasyEDA (schematic mode)
- [ ] Convert to PCB mode
- [ ] Autotrace and correct traces (if necessary)
- [ ] Export .dxf to Rhino7 and draw vectors (holes diameter 1 mm, trace width 1 mm)
- [ ] Mirror PCB
- [ ] ArtCAM .gcode
- [ ] Milling traces and holes
- [ ] Removing the copper layer completely from the opposite side
- [ ] Add design

Components used:
- Arduino Pro Micro
- NRF+
- Joystick
